# Netflix_clone_2023


Netflix - is ​​an American entertainment company and a streaming service for films and TV series
Since 2013, Netflix has produced its own films and series, including animated ones, as well as television programs
I recreated an application close to the analogue
Used the Netflix API to load a random photo of the day on the main screen
Next, content is downloaded by category

There is "TabBarViewController", which contains the view:
- loading content by category
- downloading developing content
- loading content search by title
- playback of downloaded content
Every content you like can be played via YouTube

Good luck and good and readable code to everyone
If you like it, use it

Works only with VPN
